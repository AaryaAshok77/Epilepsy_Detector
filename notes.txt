CHBM-MIT EEG Dataset and Labeling for Binary Classification
The CHBM-MIT EEG dataset does not have a separate "healthy" dataset for control purposes. However, this doesn't necessarily cause major issues for your initial binary classification goal. Here's why:

Dataset Labeling Plan:

The CHBM-MIT EEG dataset already provides labels for each recording, indicating whether it's:
Ictal: Represents a segment containing seizure activity.
Interictal: Represents a segment not containing seizure activity.
Binary Classification Approach:

Instead of having a separate "healthy" group, you can directly use the interictal segments as your negative class (representing non-epileptic activity).
This approach assumes that interictal segments represent brain activity during non-seizure periods, which is generally true.
Potential Issues:

While interictal segments are not explicitly labeled as "healthy," they might still contain abnormal brain activity not present in a truly healthy individual.
This might slightly affect the generalizability of your model to real-world scenarios with truly healthy subjects.
Addressing Potential Issues:

To mitigate these concerns, you can consider:
Filtering the interictal data: Use stricter criteria to select interictal segments with minimal abnormal activity, potentially based on expert annotations or additional filtering techniques.
Acknowledge the limitations: In your research and any resulting publications, acknowledge that the interictal class might not perfectly represent true "healthy" activity.
Classifications Possible with CHBM-MIT EEG:

With the provided labeling, you can perform the following binary classification:

Ictal (seizure) vs. Interictal (non-seizure): This is the initial goal you mentioned, aiming to distinguish segments containing seizure activity from those without.
However, the dataset does not allow for classifications like:

Specific seizure type: The labels only indicate the presence or absence of seizure activity, not the specific type (e.g., focal, generalized).
Healthy vs. Epileptic: As discussed earlier, the dataset doesn't have a dedicated "healthy" class for direct comparison.
Remember, this initial binary classification using the existing labels is a stepping stone for your research. You can explore other datasets or techniques for more granular classifications (e.g., seizure types) if needed later in your research journey.



Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing Steps for Seizure Detection Neural Network:

Based on the data description provided, here are some steps you can take to preprocess the data for your neural network:

1. Loading and Organizing Data:
    Read files:** Use libraries like `pandas` or `numpy` to read the relevant files:
     `RECORDS`: List of all `.edf` files.
     `RECORDS-WITH-SEIZURES`: List of files containing seizures.
     `chbnn-summary.txt`: Files with seizure information and timing.
    Merge information:** Combine relevant data from different files into a single dataframe/structure. This could include:
     File names
     Subject information (gender, age)
     Seizure information (presence, timing)
     Montage information (electrode placement)

2. Preprocessing EEG Data (.edf files):
    Load and segment EEG data:** Use libraries like `pyedflib` or `mne` to load and segment the .edf files into smaller segments (e.g., 1-second windows).
    Filtering:** Apply band-pass filtering to remove noise outside the relevant frequency range for seizure detection (typically 1-40 Hz).
    Normalization:** Standardize or normalize the EEG data across channels and segments to ensure equal weight during training.
    Windowing (optional):** Apply windowing functions (e.g., Hanning window) to reduce spectral leakage when segmenting the data.

3. Preprocessing Seizure Labels:
    Define labels:** Assign labels to each data segment based on the seizure information:
     1: Segment contains a seizure
     0: Segment does not contain a seizure
    Balance classes (optional): If the number of segments with seizures is significantly lower, consider balancing the classes (e.g., oversampling or undersampling) to avoid bias in the neural network.

4. Feature Engineering (optional):
    Extract additional features relevant to seizure detection from the preprocessed data. This could involve:
        Statistical features:** Mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, etc., calculated across windows.
        Spectral features:** Power spectral density (PSD) analysis, extracting features like band power in specific frequency bands.
        Time-frequency features:** Applying techniques like Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or Wavelet Transform to capture combined time and frequency information.

5. Splitting Data:
    Divide your data into training, validation, and testing sets:
        Training set: Used to train the neural network.
        Validation set: Used to monitor performance during training and prevent overfitting.
        Testing set: Used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model on unseen data.

    Additional Tips:
        Document your preprocessing steps carefully so you can reproduce your results and compare different configurations.
        Consider visualizing the preprocessed data (e.g., filtered EEG, feature distributions) to gain insights into the data and potential challenges.
        Explore advanced preprocessing techniques based on your specific research question and dataset characteristics.

By following these steps and considering potential nuances based on your chosen neural network architecture, you can prepare your seizure detection data effectively 
for machine learning use. Remember, the specific preprocessing choices may need further refinement based on further exploratory analysis and model performance evaluation.
